# Medicine Inventory Database Project

## Project Overview
Contributing to the provision and facilitation of the sale of medicines
is one of the most important things that can be available to patients, so
this database is a model that fulfills this role. However, its pivotal role is
to facilitate the management of the medicine inventory, as doctors write
the medical prescription, then employees take the medicine out of the
designated area, then the invoice is calculated and presented to the patient,
and all of this is stored on a database like the one we have in our hands in
this project.

## Repository Structure
- `DATABASE PROJECT.pdf` — Written report
- `Database Project Presentation.pptx` — Slides

## How to Run
